 An Developer with over 25 years of development experience using C, C++, Delphi-Paskal, Transact-SQL, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Rust ... I have focused on WordPress as a preferred platform since 2013, specializing in custom theme/plugin to match client business needs. I prefer to work on API projects and back-end development. \
For the last 10 years, the focus of my work has been mainly the development of WordPress platform features such as themes, plugins, widgets, databases, web services as well as the installation and maintenance of the servers supported by these applications.\
I have concluded that PHP and Wordpress platform is the best choice for me as a freelancer even if it is not my favorite tool but it is very easy to distribute custom wordpress plugins to clients.
I 'm the founder of the IT micro company <a href="https://konrad.rs" target="_blank"> "Konrad & Sohn doo"</a>. \
Currently (2024.) my focus has shifted to Rust, the rising star of programming languages ​​and I really enjoy working in it.  
Outside of work, I enjoy spending time in nature and hiking.
