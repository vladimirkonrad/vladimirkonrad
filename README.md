I started developing about middle 80s, it was amazing years! In the beginning, my only goal was to impress my girlfriend and my friends. I used ZX Spectrum 48 and Commodore C-64. It really was a magical time.

At the beginning of the 90's I started working in a software company. 
After a couple of years, I replaced it with another company, then a third, a fourth ... I even worked in a bank as a programmer (very stressfull time).

After almost 25 years I decided become a freelance and to work for myself. And here I am ;)
